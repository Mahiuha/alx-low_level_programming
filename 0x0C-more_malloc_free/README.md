# What I learned from this project  
At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:  
---   

**How to use the exit function?**  
*yea i did. exit witn an int parameter with the status
 exit success and exit fail are macros. use exit to quit a program and go back into the OS*  

**What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them?** 
*calloc allocates memory of an array so its like malloc but nicer. it is called via calloc(int,sizeof(datatype) and realloc reallocates more memory. we can pass the pointer and th new size we want like realloc(*pointer, 25);*  

## Each scripts and their output  
* Script 0 - Write a function that allocates memory using malloc.  
* Script 1 - Write a function that concatenates two strings.  
* Script 2 - Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.  
* Script 3 - Write a function that creates an array of integers.  
* Script 100 - Write a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free.  
* Script 101 - Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers.
