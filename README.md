alx-low_level_programming

Introduction

Each directory contains the low level projects and code that I wrote during my time at Holberton. More detailed and specific READMEs are located in each folder. The focus of these projects were to master computer science concepts and to practice the theory behind C, algorithms, and basic data structures. There is info and trivia questions that I go over in each directory.
