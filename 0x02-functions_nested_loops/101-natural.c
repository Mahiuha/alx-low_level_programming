/**
* main - prints fizz bizz type of stuff.
* Description : add up the sums of multiples of 3 and 5 till 1024
* Return: 0 if no error.
* A: While loop, starts at 0. Do the code until i is less 
* than the num, given to us by the problem (1024).
* B: If and else if are like one or the other commands.
* I could have used an if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0)
* to put both checks into one line but this was my initial code
* and I donâ€™t want to change it because I want to see
* my coding progress. So back to B, it checks if it is divisible
* by 3 or 5 and if so then we increment sum by i.
* C: We increase i and that drives us through the loop,
* we print the total in the end.
